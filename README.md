COMP 4107 Projects
Due: 21st December 2017 at 11:55 pm
Objective

The primary objective of the course project is to have the student solve a machine learning problem using real world data by building a neural network.

Submission

Submission should be to cuLearn. You are to upload a zip file containing a readme text file, python files and a single PDF file containing your report. The readme text file in the archive should provide DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS on how to set up and run your project. Note, your python submission must include a mechanism to validate your tested network. Submission is in pairs. One partner should upload a zip file, the other a readme.txt file containing the names and student numbers of both partners.

Description

The project report may be up to 4 single-spaced pages in length, not including figures. Figures should be provided at the end of your report. The report should use 10 point font for text. The report must describe: the problem being solved, neural network architecture, provide citations for work referenced, and describe the experimental methadology used to generate the results reported. MEANINGFUL EXPERIMENTATION IS EXPECTED.

You may use scikit-learn and/or tensorflow for your project. External libraries other than these must be cited in your report.

Projects

Develop a simple facial recognition system. Evaluate your system against the EigenFaces system described in the lectures.
Build a system which can determine the sentiment associated with a text document. Compare it with the Sentiment Analyzer provided in the CoreNLP library.
Use one of the recommender datasets to create a recommender system for one of the indicated domains.
Kaggle has a large number of datasets. (LOGIN REQUIRED). Of particular interest are: Bitcoin Historical Data and Daily News for Stock Market Prediction.
Train a dialog system with the tiny Shakespeare dataset
